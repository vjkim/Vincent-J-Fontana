<div class="sexual-abuse">
	<h3>Sexual abuse is contact or interaction between a child 
	and an adult when the child is being used for sexual stimulation of the perpetrator,
	or another person when the perpetrator,
	or another person is in a position of power or control over the victim.</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Sexual abuse can be as minimal as: </li> 
		<ul>
			<li>exposing a child to pornographic materials and/or adult sexual activity,</li> 
			<li>having a child pose, undress, or perform in a sexual fashion</li> 
		</ul>
		<li>It can also be as severe as:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Rape, attempted rape,or sodomy</li>
			</ul>
</ul>
		
	<p>How can we help a child who has disclosed that he or she has had sexual abuse?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Belief is key. The child is only telling you because they trust you enough to tell you.</li>
		<li>How can a kid tell you they've had as traumatic an experience as sexual abuse? Do you really think they'd make up such a thing as that?</li>
		<li>Don't act surprised or mad in front of the child, it will only suppress their emotions and make it exen harder for them to cope with the experience.</li>
		<li>Be there for your child or friend.</li>
		<li>Let them know how much they are worth, and that their experience doesn't define them.</li>
	</ul> 
</div>

	<h3>When one thinks about abuse, the word "neglect" normally doesn't register as a type of abuse, but it is indeed an abuse.</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Neglect is the denial of human rights to a child or individual. This could mean denying the child of the right of education, food, water, a decent home life among many others.</li>
		<li>Neglect becomes problematic when the child isn't treated as a child, but as an animal or inhumane being. IT could have lasting effects, and could lead to the child's </li>
