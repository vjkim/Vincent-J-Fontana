<div class="physical-abuse">
	<p>There are many different types of physical abuse. <br> 
	 This includes spanking, slapping, pinching, pulling,<br> twisting, and hitting with an object. It also may include forcing a child to consume unpleasant substances such as soap, hot sauce, or hot pepper.Â 
</p>
</div>

<div class="sexual-abuse">
	<p>Sexual abuse is contact or interaction between a child <br>
	 and an adult when the child is being used for sexual stimulation of the perpetrator, <br>
	or another person when the perpetrator,<br>
	or another person is in a position of power or control over the victim. </p>

	<p>This can happen in multiple ways, including</p>
		<li>Sexual abuse can be as minimal as: </<li> 
		<li>exposing a child to pornographic materials and/or adult sexual activity,</li> 
		<li>having a child pose, undress, or perform in a sexual fashion</li> 
		<li>It can also be as severe as:</li>
		<li>attempted rape, rape, sodomy</li>

	<p>How can we help a child who has disclosed that he or she has had sexual abuse?</p>
	<ul>
		<li>1. belief is key. The child is only telling you because they trust you enough to tell you.</li>
		<li>2. How can a kid tell you they've had as traumatic an experience as sexual abuse? Do you really think they'd make up such a thing as that?</li>
